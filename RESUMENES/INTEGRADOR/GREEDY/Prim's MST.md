Use [[Dijkstra Shortest Path in a Graph]].
Start with a root node $s$ and try to greedily grow a tree from $s$ outward. 
At each step, add the node that can be attached as cheaply as possibly to the partial tree: maintain a set $S âŠ† V$ on which a spanning tree has been constructed (initially $S = \{s\}$); in each iteration, grow $S$ by one node adding $v$ that minimizes the *attachment cost* and including the edge $e$ that achieves this minimum in the spanning tree.

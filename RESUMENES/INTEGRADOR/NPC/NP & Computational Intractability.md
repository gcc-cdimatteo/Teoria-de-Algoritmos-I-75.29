- **Complexity class $P$**: set of decision problems for which exists an algorithm that can solve any instance of a problem in polynomial time.
- **Complexity class $NP$**: set of decision problems for which exists a certifier that can verify any instance of a problem with evidence in polynomial time.
- $P ⊆ NP$: if a problem is contained in $P$ exists an algorithm that can solve it in polynomial time; therefore exists a certifier that can certify the problem in polynomial time.
- $Y ≤_p X$: if $X$ can be solved in polynomial time, then $Y$ can be solved in polynomial time.
- $Y ≤_p X$: if $Y$ cannot be solved in polynomial time, then $X$ cannot be solved in polynomial time.
- $𝑋 \in 𝑁𝑃-𝐻ard ⇔ ∀ 𝑌∈𝑁𝑃: 𝑌 ≤_p 𝑋$
- $𝑋∈𝑁𝑃-𝐶ompleto ⇔ 𝑋∈𝑁𝑃 ∧ 𝑋∈𝑁𝑃-𝐻ard$

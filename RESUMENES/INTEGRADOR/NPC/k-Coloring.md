#NPC for $k>3$
## Problem
Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a k- coloring of $G$ is a function $f :V →{1,2,...,k}$ so that for every edge $(u,v)$, $f(u) ≠ f(v) \implies$ $f$ represents the choice of a color for each node. If $G$ has a k-coloring, it is a k-colorable graph.
## Decision Problem
Given a graph $G$ and a bound $k$, does $G$ have a k-coloring?

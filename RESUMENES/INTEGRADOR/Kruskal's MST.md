Starts without any edges.
Build a spanning tree by successively inserting edges from $E$ in order of *increasing cost*: insert each edge $e$ as long as it does not create a cycle when added to the edges already inserted.
### Pseudocode
#incomplete 
### Proof of Optimality
#incomplete 
### Time Complexity
Because of the edge sorting by increasing cost $$O(V \log{E})$$

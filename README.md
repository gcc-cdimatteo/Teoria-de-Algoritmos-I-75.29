# stable-matching-greedy
Stable Matching Problem solved by Greedy Algorithm

## Instructions
1. run *generate_points.py* to build new testing points
2. run *stable_matching.py* to run the actual algorith
3. run *print_points.py* to draw the resulting matches

## Notes
change
- *HKEY_FILE_PATH_A* to change the source of the A conjunt points
- *HKEY_FILE_PATH_B* to change the source of the B conjunt points
- *HKEY_FILE_PATH_MATCHES* to change the source of de matches points
- *HKEY_TEST_BEG_RANGE* to change the beginning range of the testing points
- *HKEY_TEST_END_RANGE* to change the end range of the testing points
- *HKEY_TEST_POINT_QUANTITY* to change the quantity of the testing points that will be generated
